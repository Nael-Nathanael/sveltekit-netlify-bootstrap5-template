# SvelteKit-Netlify-Bootstrap5

SvelteKit template, netlify deployments configured, and add ready-to-use bootstrap 5 classes (unwraped)

## Notes

- Made firstly as a template for my personal projects, so I didn't need to reconfigure everything whenever I start new
  project.
- I didn't know if this is best practice or not, please give suggestion regarding what need to be changed to achieve
  best practice.
- If you interested, feel free to use. Credit is optional.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a
development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your
target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```
